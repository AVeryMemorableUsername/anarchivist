      <h2>Welcome to the Anarchivist! Your fourth strongest (video game refrence) uncited news source, here to talk about the good :3<br> <br> This periodical serves to document any progress in the world that goes towards freedom of the people and the abolishment of the state. We are ran by three queer dorks in a very eclectic polycule, so this site is very safe for other queer folks! <br> <br> This is a far-left publication, if the anarcha-queer colour palette didn't give it off already. As impolitely as possible, <strong>fascists fuck off!</strong></h2>

      <h4>This weeks' article:</h4>
      <h1>January 2025, W4;<br><br><br>Our New Years Resolution Is Freedom</h1>

      <p>2025 has been a bit of a shitshow so far, as sad as it is to say. America has gone down the seeminlgly consistent path of authoritarianism, drug wars in Colombia are leaving tons of people dead, and the worlds richest 0.1% are slowly building up to being the worlds richest 0.00001%. But it's not like this year has been all bad! Right?</p>
      <p>We can't speak on the whole month, because this periodical focuses on events across the whole world and not just the specific bubble in North America you only ever hear about on the news, and that is a LOT to read through. Especially when only 3 people in a polycule are running this! But this past week, progress is being made, just as it is every other week no matter how it seems.</p>

      <p><strong>IN AUSTRALIA:</strong> For those not from Australia, the 26th of January is legally recognised as Australia Day. However, despite the name, it does not take place on the day of Australia's founding or independence, rather the day the First Fleet arrived with swathes of prisoners on inhabitated land; the Aboriginal peoples and the Torres Strait Islanders had been living here for countless thousands of years beforehand. Upon the First Fleet's arrival, the traditional custodians of the land suffered so many hardships, continuing even after Australia became a nation in 1901. To many, this day is not seen as Australia Day, but rather a day of mourning, colloquially known as Invasion Day.</p>
      <p>We bring this up for one specific reason; obviously, that day was recently. Normally, these days go by a specific way; conservatives and the Liberal National Party, or LNP, cry 'woke' about how their favourite day is being ruined. However, some very vocal neo-Nazis decided to be loud, but were arrested during an attempt to break up Invasion Day rallies in South Australia. These rallies were attended by tens of thousands of people, and they all gathered to protest the date the day is celebrated on. It might not be taking down patriotism in its entirety, but it is a tiny thing that matters enough, and it's good that people care.</p>
      <p><strong>IN GERMANY:</strong> The far-right fascist party Alternative für Deutschland, or AfD, recently made the admittedly bold, but more importantly concerning, move to invite Elon Musk, now open Nazi and worlds richest man, to talk at a rally. Over fifteen-thousand people attended protests against the AfD as they begin their election campaign, singing anti-fascist tunes, blowing whistles and waving signs. It's admittedly gentler than the fascist party deserves, but protests are protests and we should be thankful people care at all still! On the bright side, no other party wants to be involved with the AfD, and their chances of winning are slim-to-none.</p>
      <p><strong>IN SERBIA:</strong> Aleksandar Vučić has had power in Serbia for almost 8 years, and during his extensive tenure he has degraded civil liberties severely. On January 25th, numerous protests, which were organised by students and have been going on for two months, have been gaining more traction. The protests have become more popular after fitfteen deaths in the collapse of a canopy on a Novi Sad railway, citing government corruption and ignorance. Tens of thousands of people have been blocking streets across the entire country, and holding demonstrations and marches in almost every major city.</p>
      <p>If this was your boring right-wing news show, this'd be all you hear. The motivation behind the protests is about much more than just their deaths; the Serbian government is corrupt, and they would never hold accountability for anyones death. Even Vučić, who has blood on his hands <a href="#section1">[1]</a>, couldn't admit to killing someone when he claimed he would do it earlier. The people of Serbia want him gone, no matter how much the autocrat would like to think otherwise, and his time is running out. That's not a threat, by the way! He's tried to hold counter-protests and he's lucky to get a few thousand to come.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the protests, despite their size, are not without their counteractions. Two attacks have happened since it started, with two cars driving into protestors as they block traffic. However, the people are still going strong, and the numbers fighting against Vučić are only getting larger!</p>
      <p><strong>IN ARGENTINA:</strong> Anti-fascists and pro-LGBTQIA+ protesters have organised to march on February 1st, fighting against Javier Milei, current president of Argentina and outspoken anarcho-capitalist <a href="#section2">[2]</a>. The conversation about protesting came about after Milei went on the usual 'anti-woke' rant, as well as after he bragged about his connections to major far-right politicians such as Trump, current unwanted president of America, and Netanyahu, war-mongerer and prime minister of Israel. </p>
      <p>Even before the protest, eight-thousand people lined up for the anti-fascist assembly on the 25th to discuss their plan of action. A La Libertad Avanza voter and follower attempted to stream the event but was chased off. Let's hope that, while Milei likely won't get kicked out, the demands will be met by whatever government is in next! And of course, if that doesn't work, let's hope the people of Argentina are swift to fight again!</p>

      <p>Thus concludes the first ever post on the Anarchivist. We can't wait to get into the swing of this, and bring the joy of progress to the world so we can smile and cheer for something good, even while evil keeps spitting in our faces. Take care of yourselves, people. You matter the most, nothing else comes close. Stay safe, be strong, and fight so the world will get better!</p>

      <p id="section1"> <a href="#section1">[1]</a> Search up Slavko Ćuruvija. He was killed in 1999, not long after Vućić declared that he would 'wreak vengeance' on Ćuruvija. His death was not 'resolved' until 2014, over fifteen years later. In 2024, the 'culprits' were acquitted. Ćuruvija is heavily overdue justice.</p>
      <p id="section2"> <a href="#section2">[2]</a>Not to get opinionated, but fuck anarcho-capitalists. It's just libertarianism with extra steps. Milei can go kiss a brick <3 </p>
